In Mongoose, a schema defines the structure of documents in a MongoDB collection, while a model provides an interface for interacting with the database to create, read, update, and delete documents.
A schema is an object that defines the properties of a document, their types, and their default values. It can also be used to define validators for ensuring that data is entered correctly.
A model is a class that is created from a schema. It provides methods for interacting with the database, such as save(), find(), update(), and delete().
Here is an example of a schema for a user document:
const userSchema = new Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  age: Number,
});

You can use the model() function to create a model from a schema. The first argument to the model() function is the name of the model, and the second argument is the schema.
Once you have created a model, you can use it to interact with the database. For example, you can use the save() method to save a document to the database, and you can use the find() method to find documents in the database.
